\section{Related Work}
The database community has paid significant attention to improve join performance in the past decade. 
Blanas et al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/BlanasLP11} analyzed the join performance in single socket, large main-memory server environments using various join implementations such as radix-based partitioning, no-partitioned join and using uniform as well as skewed data sets. 

Schuh et al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/SchuhCD16} reviewed various join implementations from the research literature from the past decade. 
They classified the join algorithms in two categories - partitioning based and no-partitioning based join algorithms, and compared their performance characteristics. 
As they observed, prior work on join performance has mostly focused on synthetic queries and synthetic datasets. 
In the interest of discussing the join algorithm performance in the context of real life queries, they measured the performance of various join algorithms on a real query (TPC-H Query 19).
